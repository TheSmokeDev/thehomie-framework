"""Mental process state machine — 5 modes with keyword-based detection.

Classifies incoming messages into conversation modes (planning, monitoring,
learning, execution, default) using regex/keyword signals. Each mode maps
to region weight multipliers that adjust prompt assembly emphasis.

CRITICAL: Detection is heuristic only — no LLM calls. Transitions are
implicit routing, never announced to the user.

Pattern: recall.py classify_tier() — regex pattern matching for classification.
Pattern: continuity.py — dataclass + state tracking.
