"""Phase 2.3.1 — IO helpers for the veto layer.

Two responsibilities:

1. ``load_report_delta(path)`` — load a saved ``ReportDelta`` JSON with
   fail-fast on missing aggregates AND recompute of derived counts from
   ``per_query``. The recompute defeats stale/hand-edited delta files where
   per-query verdicts disagree with the cached aggregate counts (Codex
   review 2026-04-25 Finding 2). Cached aggregates are NOT trusted as the
   gate input — they are caches that can drift.

2. ``write_decision_artifact(out_dir, ...)`` — persist the veto decision
   alongside the candidate report so the audit trail survives without
   stdout capture (Codex review 2026-04-25 Finding 5). The decision JSON
   records ``delta``, ``verdict``, ``force``, ``effective_exit_code``, and
   the experiment IDs — the full context a future reviewer needs to
   understand why a candidate was adopted, rejected, or sent to review.

Pure stdlib. No provider deps. The only clock read is in
``write_decision_artifact``'s timestamp; ``load_report_delta`` is pure.
