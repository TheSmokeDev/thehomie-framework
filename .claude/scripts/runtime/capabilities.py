"""Named capability tiers and capability/toolset aggregator.

This module serves a dual role:

1. Three legacy string constants (``TEXT_REASONING``, ``TOOL_REASONING``,
   ``VOICE_AUXILIARY``) used throughout the runtime for capability tier
   selection. These are the original contents of the file and remain
   importable unchanged — 16+ files in the codebase depend on them.

2. The capability aggregator — ``Capability`` dataclass, ``_AGGREGATORS``
   dispatch dict, ``register_aggregator()`` helper,
   ``_aggregate_chat_extensions()`` aggregator, ``list_capabilities()``
   entry point with the ``capabilities_resolved`` Langfuse span, and the
   Hermes-faithful ``resolve_toolset()`` recursive resolver.

PRP reference: ``PRPs/active/PRP-framework-capability-toolsets-1a.md``.

Hermes pattern source: ``~/hermes-agent/toolsets.py`` lines
504-554 (resolver) + the static ``TOOLSETS`` dict literal at lines 68+.
The Homie ports Hermes verbatim with one product-justified extension
(``live_source`` / ``live_filter`` for auto-discovery).

              non-namespaced form ``chat.intent.<command>`` and silently
              deduplicated cross-extension intents).
